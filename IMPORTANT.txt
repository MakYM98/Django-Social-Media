Step 2: Install virutal environment package.
pip install virtualenvwrapper

Step 3: Make a new virtual environment.
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 adv_web_env

Step 4: Ensure that you have activated the virtual environment.
workon adv_web_env

Step 5: Install all necessary libraries.
cd /path/to/project/folder
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 6: Start the application and visit 127.0.0.1:8000 on web browser
redis-server & python3 manage.py tailwind start & python3 manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

** For Step 6 you can either run all three commands together or split them
into 3 different terminals


For running all the test cases, run the following command.
